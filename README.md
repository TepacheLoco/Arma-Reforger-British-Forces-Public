### *Hold Fast, for Queen and Country.*

Deploy into the Cold War’s final chapter with **British Forces**, a full-scale unofficial expansion for _Arma Reforger_. This mod adds a complete 1980s British Army faction, introducing new weapons, vehicles, mechanics, and scenarios.

Equip your section with iconic firearms like the L1A1 SLR, GPMG and L85A1, and suit up in period-authentic uniforms and equipment. Engage in scenarios inspired by real-world doctrine and adapt your strategy to the capabilities and limitations of British military equipment.
